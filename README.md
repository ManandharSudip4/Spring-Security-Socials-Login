# Social Media Based Authentication - OAuth
## Single Sign On With GitHub
    Here, i tried to authenticate the user using github account where when ever user tries to access
    homepage, user gets redirected to Github Login page to access our 3rd party application.

    Nothing complex is done here, just added the OAuth-Client dependency and configured application.yml 
    file shown in this Spring Official guide.
